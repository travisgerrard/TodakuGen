# MongoDB to PostgreSQL Migration Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Database Configuration**
   - Created a Sequelize instance to connect to PostgreSQL
   - Updated environment variables to include PostgreSQL connection details
   - Set up model synchronization for development environment

2. **Model Conversion**
   - Migrated all Mongoose schemas to Sequelize models:
     - User
     - Story
     - Vocabulary
     - Grammar
   - Created proper model associations using Sequelize relationships
   - Set up join tables for many-to-many relationships
   - Preserved data structure while adapting to relational database patterns

3. **Controller Updates**
   - Updated controllers to use Sequelize query syntax
   - Replaced MongoDB methods like `findById` with Sequelize equivalents like `findByPk`
   - Updated query parameters to use `where` clauses instead of direct object matching

4. **Authentication Middleware**
   - Updated auth middleware to work with PostgreSQL
   - Modified user lookup logic to use Sequelize's `findByPk` method

5. **Migration Script**
   - Created a comprehensive migration script to move data from MongoDB to PostgreSQL
   - Implemented ID mapping to maintain relationships between entities
   - Added proper error handling to ensure data integrity

6. **Dependencies**
   - Added PostgreSQL and Sequelize dependencies
   - Removed MongoDB dependencies
   - Updated package scripts to include migration commands

## Next Steps

1. **Run the Migration**
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```
   This will transfer all your existing data from MongoDB to PostgreSQL.

2. **Update Controllers**
   - The remaining controllers need to be updated to use Sequelize syntax
   - Follow the pattern established in `authController.js`

3. **Test the Application**
   - After migration, thoroughly test all functionality to ensure everything works with PostgreSQL

4. **Database Maintenance**
   - Set up regular backups for your PostgreSQL database
   - Consider implementing database versioning using Sequelize migrations for future schema changes

## Benefits of PostgreSQL

- **Data Integrity**: Enforced schema and relationships ensure data consistency
- **Transactions**: ACID-compliant transactions for safer operations
- **Advanced Queries**: Powerful querying capabilities with SQL
- **Performance**: Better performance for complex joins and analytics
- **Scaling**: Mature scaling options for high-traffic applications
